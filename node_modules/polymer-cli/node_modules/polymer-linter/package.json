  "readme": "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Polymer/polymer-linter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Polymer/polymer-linter)\n[![NPM version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/polymer-linter.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-linter)\n\n# Polymer Linter\n\nA library for finding and reporting on suspicious patterns and errors in web projects.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe Polymer Linter can be run from command line with the [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli), or though IDE plugins, such as the [VS Code Plugin](https://github.com/Polymer/vscode-plugin).\n\nFirst though, it needs to be configured. Create a `polymer.json` file at the root of your project and ensure it has a \"lint\" field like so:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"lint\": {\n    \"rules\": [\"polymer-2-hybrid\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can specify either individual rules, or rule collections. See `polymer lint --help` for a full listing.\n\n### From the command line\n\npolymer-lint is run on the command line through Polymer CLI:\n\n```\n  npm install -g polymer-cli\n  cd my-project\n  polymer lint\n```\n\nBy default this produces output with the exact location of any issues clearly underlined:\n\n```\n    <paper-button opan=\"{{nonono}}\"></paper-button>\n                  ~~~~\n\nmy-elem.html(9,24) warning [set-unknown-attribute] - paper-button elements do not have a property named opan. Consider instead:  open\n```\n\n### Inside your editor\n\npolymer-lint is also integrated into a number of editor plugins for instant as-you-type linting. See [the polymer editor service](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-editor-service) for details.\n\n![Animated gif of the VSCode with the linter running.](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1659/23933285/ad63eb62-08fa-11e7-819b-641bf83cf9c6.gif)\n\n### Use with other tools\n\nThe linter checks specifically for potential issues in custom elements and Polymer. It's best paired with other more general purpose linters such as [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [htmlint](https://github.com/htmllint/htmllint).\n\n## Extending and contributing\n\nThe linter is built on top of the [polymer analyzer](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-analyzer). A lint rule is given a `Document` object with an AST that can be walked, as well as the ability to query high level features of the document like imports and custom elements. From this is just has to return an array of warnings to display.\n\nFor a simple example, see [behaviors-spelling](src/polymer/behaviors-spelling.ts), which implements a check for the commonwealth spelling of the property `behaviors` on a Polymer element.\n\nIn the future we will support loading lint rules dynamically through a plugin system, but initially all lint rules live in this repo. You'll want to import your rule from [rules.ts](src/rules.ts), and you probably want to add your rule to one or more [rule collections](src/collections.ts).\n\n### Testing\n\nRun tests with `npm test`. Test code goes in `src/test` and fixtures go in `test/`. Each lint rule should test that it is registered correctly, and that it causes neither false positives nor false negatives.\n\nSee [behaviors-spelling_test.ts](src/test/polymer/behaviors-spelling_test.ts) for an example.\n\nWe also have an integration test that runs the `polymer-2-hybrid` rule collection over all of PolymerElements. Run it with `npm run test:integration`. It's an excellent way to test for false positives.\n\n### New Lint Rules Welcome!\n\nMore lint rules are very much welcome! We're happy to answer questions. We've got a very welcoming community, come join us in the [#tools channel on slack](https://polymer.slack.com/messages/tools)! ([invites emailed automatically here](https://polymer-slack.herokuapp.com/))\n\n## Looking for Polylint?\n\nPolymer Linter is the successor to [polylint](https://www.github.com/polymerlabs/polylint).\n\n",
